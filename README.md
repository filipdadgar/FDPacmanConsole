This is a simple console-based implementation of Pacman with basic functionality:

Pacman can move using arrow keys.
Ghosts move randomly around the board.
Dots are collected when Pacman moves over them (no scoring implemented).
Walls block movement.
Game ends if Pacman collides with a ghost.
To make it more complete, you could add:

Power pills
Scoring system
Lives system
Better AI for ghosts
Sound effects
More polished visuals using Unicode characters or colors
To run the game:

Save all the files in the same directory.
Compile and run the console application.
Use arrow keys to control Pacman, and try to avoid the ghosts!
